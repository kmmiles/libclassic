### faq

q. is this pre-alpha software?

a. yes

q. why is the bundle so large?

a. it's big and going to get bigger. all the items, spells, icons, etc are included. there might be additional bundle choices in the future.

q. is it a simulator?

a. kind of. it's not a monte carlo (sims that iterate thousands of times with random sampling and averaging the results). it uses calculations in order to display
results in "real-time".
