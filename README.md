# libclassic

This project provides javascript calculations for the game World of Warcraft Classic, in the form of 
an open source MIT licensed typescript library. 

The primary motivation is to facilite the conversion of spreadsheets into user-friendly web applications. 
A secondary motivation is documenting game mechanics in a form that's simple to understand and demonstrate.

This project was born out of the Moonkin Calculator app, which was initially a web conversion of
Keftenk's Balance Druid spreadsheet.
